      <h2>Linear Search</h2>
      <p>A Linear Search is the most basic type of searching algorithm. 
      A Linear Search sequentially moves through your collection (or data
       structure) looking for a matching value. In other words, it looks down a list, 
       one item at a time, without jumping.</p>

       <h4> Approach </h4>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <p className="linear_step">Sequentially move through the array from the leftmost side and start comparing the value
            you want to search (let x) with each element of array.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p className="linear_step">
           If x matches with an element then return the index.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
           <p className="linear_step">
           If x does not match with any of the elements then return -1.
           </p>
         </li>
       </ul>
       <img className="linear__code" src="https://github.com/rohitsigar/ILLITRATE/blob/master/src/Assets/linearCode%20Snippet.PNG?raw=true"alt="/"></img>
       <p classname="linear_ques">
       If there is a n sized array & you have to find element-x from the array, 
       then what is the average number of indexes you have to traverse? 
       <span className="linear_think">Think about it?</span>
       </p>
       <h4> Time Complexity </h4>
       <p classname="linear_timeCom">
       The time required to search an element using a linear search algorithm depends on the size of the list. Within the best-case situation, the component is present at the starting of
        the list and within the worst-case, it is display at the end. <br></br><br></br>We can conclude that "Time Complexity" for linear Search is
        <br></br><h3>Best: O(1) </h3><h3> Average: O(n) </h3><h3> Worst: O(n)</h3>
       </p>
       <h6 className="linear__con">Overall Linear Search is an important concept to understand when it comes to algorithms.</h6>
